"""Claude CLI Stop hook endpoint.

The only hook CodePlane registers with Claude CLI is the Stop hook.
Claude POSTs synchronously on every Stop event. The response can include
operator messages queued by CodePlane's supervision UI.

All session data ingestion is handled by ClaudeSessionStateWatcher via
file-tailing — hooks are NOT used for data ingestion.
