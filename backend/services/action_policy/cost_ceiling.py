"""CodePlane USD cost-ceiling policy assessor — a native TraceForge extension.

TraceForge's budget is tool-call *count* based. CodePlane additionally tracks a
real **USD** spend per job (``job_telemetry_summary.total_cost_usd``), and the
product surfaces a per-preset dollar ceiling. Rather than translate that spend
into TraceForge's vocabulary (a charter-forbidden bridge), we extend TraceForge
in its own idiom: :class:`JobSpendCeilingAssessor` implements the documented
:class:`~traceforge.governance.rules.PolicyAssessor` protocol
(``assess(ctx, now) -> PolicyDecision | None``) and is registered alongside the
built-in assessors via ``GovernancePipeline(policy_assessors=…)``. Its
``PolicyDecision`` is folded into the verdict by TraceForge's own severity
lattice — no CodePlane ``Tier``, no shape or vocabulary translation.

The assessor is **read-only** (it only reads CP's spend accounting) so it is safe
on the preflight decision path. It is *elevate-only*: it raises ESCALATE at the
hard ceiling or WARN at the soft warn line, and abstains (``None``) otherwise —
TraceForge assessors may only ever increase severity.
