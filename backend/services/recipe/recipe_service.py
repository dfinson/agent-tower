"""Task Recipe ingestion orchestration (Story 4.2, CAP-9/AD-9).

``RecipeService.ingest_project`` is a stateless, on-demand function — never
a background watcher/poller. It is Project-scoped: it iterates exactly
``project.repo_paths`` (AD-5), parses each member repo's BMAD stories and
spec-kit ``tasks.md`` independently and read-only, resolves ``depends_on``
edges into unambiguous composite ``"{repo_path}::{story_node_id}"`` keys
across the whole Project (since ``story_node_id`` is only unique within one
repo), and upserts one ``TaskLinkRow`` per parsed task — never duplicating
across re-runs.
