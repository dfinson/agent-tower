"""Map TraceForge ``TitleUpdate`` values to CodePlane ``turn_summary`` payloads.

Extracted from the ``lifespan`` title-pipeline callback so the mapping is a
pure, importable, unit-testable function (the callback itself stays thin).

Only TF-native fields are surfaced — there is no synthetic CodePlane inference
of fields TF does not supply (``plan_item_id``, ``activity_status``). An
``activity``-kind update's native ``title`` *is* that activity's label, so it is
carried as ``activity_label`` for the timeline's activity-group header. A
``step``-kind update's ``title`` is the step's own title (not the activity
label), so ``activity_label`` is intentionally omitted for steps — the label
established by the parent activity update is preserved by the frontend reducer.
