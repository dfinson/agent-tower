"""Shared event processing pipeline for agent sessions.

Both RuntimeService (managed SDK sessions) and the imported-ingestion sources
funnel ``traceforge.SessionEvent`` values through this single processor. Events
arrive already in TF-native shape (dotted ``kind``, TF payload fields); this
processor enriches via TraceForge, annotates, and publishes:

  1. **TraceForge Enricher** — tool pairing, classification, visibility, phases,
     duration, risk scoring.  ``metadata.tool_display`` is derived from the
     native classification so no per-tool-name alias table is needed.
  2. Diff triggering on file edits / tool completions
  3. turn_id synthesis + rotation for producers that don't supply one
  4. StepTracker annotation (step boundaries, step_number)
  5. TrailService step_id enrichment
  6. EventBus publishing
  7. **Title pipeline** — boundary + title inference producing
     ``TitleUpdate`` → ``turn_summary`` events via EventBus.

This is the one funnel for both producers — there is exactly one event shape.
