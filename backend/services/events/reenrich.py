"""Idempotent re-enrichment of persisted events through TraceForge.

Replays a job's stored ``SessionEvent`` values through a fresh
``traceforge.Enricher`` instance in temporal order so that
classification, visibility, phases, duration_ms, risk scoring, and
tool_display are backfilled on events that predate the inline
enrichment wiring.

The path is bounded (batched pagination, not full memory load),
deterministic (same enricher, same event order → same output),
concurrency-safe (per-job asyncio lock prevents duplicate replay),
and durable-no-repeat (a marker event prevents double processing;
force deletes then re-inserts the marker).
