"""Remote-origin probing for the restart helper's ``checking_remote`` phase.

Resolves the exact origin the restart helper must probe after replacing a
running CodePlane process, and performs a single bounded reachability check
against that exact origin (SPEC.md CAP-6, ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md AD-8). Never
scans local processes or spawns a connector to discover an origin — the
origin is always read directly off a ``LaunchProfile`` — matching CAP-6's
"external tunnel mode never scans/spawns" requirement.

Owned by this integration slice (coordinated with integration session
3fd0b7af-27ee-4346-9098-911b5350a34c). ``backend.services.dev_restart.
restart_helper`` is expected to import and call these two functions from its
``RestartPhase.checking_remote`` step in a follow-up commit from that
session; this module intentionally does not modify ``restart_helper.py``
itself.
