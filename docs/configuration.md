# Configuration

CodePlane works out of the box with sensible defaults. This page covers the settings you're most likely to change.

## First-Time Setup

Run the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
cpl setup
```

This walks you through registering a repository, selecting a default agent, and setting preferences.

## Global Config File

Location: `~/.codeplane/config.yaml` (created on first run or via `cpl setup`).

### Agent Defaults

```yaml
agent:
  default_sdk: copilot              # agent CLI to use: copilot | claude
  default_model: ~                  # model name, or ~ for agent default
  permission_mode: full_auto        # full_auto | observe_only | review_and_approve
```

| Permission Mode | Behavior |
|-----------------|---------|
| `full_auto` | All agent actions within the worktree are auto-approved — no prompts (default) |
| `observe_only` | Agent can read files and run safe commands (grep, ls, find); all writes and mutations are blocked |
| `review_and_approve` | Reads always allowed; file writes, shell commands (except grep/find), and network access pause for your approval |

### Server

```yaml
server:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8080
```

### Retention

```yaml
retention:
  max_completed_jobs: 100           # auto-cleanup oldest when exceeded
  max_worktree_age_hours: 72        # auto-delete old worktrees
```

## Per-Repository Overrides

Place a `.codeplane.yml` file in any repository root to override global settings for jobs in that repo:

```yaml
agent:
  default_sdk: claude
  default_model: claude-sonnet-4-5
  permission_mode: review_and_approve
```

## Remote Access

Run the agent on your workstation, control it from your phone or any browser. CodePlane supports two tunnel providers.

### Dev Tunnels (default)

**Prerequisite:** Install the [Dev Tunnels CLI](https://aka.ms/devtunnels/cli), or run `cpl setup` which handles it for you.

```bash
cpl up --remote                              # password auto-generated
cpl up --remote --password my-secret         # explicit password
cpl up --remote --tunnel-name my-tunnel      # reuse a named tunnel
```

A password is always required for remote access. By default one is auto-generated; set it explicitly via `--password` or the `CPL_PASSWORD` env var.

After startup, run `cpl info` to print the tunnel URL and a QR code you can scan from your phone.

### Cloudflare Tunnels

Use Cloudflare Tunnels when you want a stable public hostname (e.g., `codeplane.yourdomain.com`) instead of the auto-provisioned Dev Tunnels URL.

!!! danger "Cloudflare Access is required"
    Cloudflare Tunnels have no identity gate by default. CodePlane will **refuse to start** unless it detects a [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) application on the hostname.

**Prerequisites:**

1. Install [`cloudflared`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/)
2. [Create a named tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/) and route a public hostname to `http://localhost:8080`
3. [Create a Cloudflare Access application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-app/) on that hostname with an identity policy. Email OTP is the simplest option; SSO and mTLS are also supported.

**Start CodePlane:**

```bash
export CPL_CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN=eyJhIjo...      # from tunnel setup
export CPL_CLOUDFLARE_HOSTNAME=codeplane.yourdomain.com
cpl up --remote --provider cloudflare
```

At startup, CodePlane probes the hostname for a Cloudflare Access gate. If none is detected, the server exits with an error.

#### Cloudflare Access JWT Verification

When `cloudflared` is managed externally (e.g., a systemd service or Docker sidecar) and CodePlane is not started with `--remote --provider cloudflare`, you can still delegate authentication to Cloudflare Access by configuring JWT verification:

```bash
export CPL_CF_ACCESS_TEAM=yourteam            # <team> in <team>.cloudflareaccess.com
export CPL_CF_ACCESS_AUD=your-aud-tag-here    # Application Audience Tag from Zero Trust dashboard
```

At startup CodePlane fetches Cloudflare's JWKS signing keys (validating the Access gate exists) and then cryptographically verifies the `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` header on every request — checking signature, audience, and expiry. If either variable is missing, the header is ignored and normal password auth applies.

You can find the AUD tag in the Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard under **Access → Applications → your app → Overview → Application Audience (AUD) Tag**.

### All Remote Options

| CLI Flag | Env Var | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--remote` | — | Enable remote access (required) |
| `--provider` | — | `devtunnel` (default) or `cloudflare` |
| `--password SECRET` | `CPL_PASSWORD` | Auth password (auto-generated if omitted) |
| `--tunnel-name NAME` | `CPL_DEVTUNNEL_NAME` | Reuse a named Dev Tunnel across restarts |
| — | `CPL_CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` | Cloudflare Tunnel token |
| — | `CPL_CLOUDFLARE_HOSTNAME` | Cloudflare public hostname |
| — | `CPL_CF_ACCESS_TEAM` | CF Access team name (for JWT verification) |
| — | `CPL_CF_ACCESS_AUD` | CF Access Application Audience tag |

## Other Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT` | OTLP endpoint for exporting metrics/traces | — (local only) |

## MCP Server Discovery

When a job starts, CodePlane discovers MCP servers to make available to the agent. Servers are merged from two sources (repo-level wins on name conflicts):

1. **Repo-level:** `.vscode/mcp.json` in the repository (VS Code / Copilot convention)
2. **Global:** `tools.mcp` in `~/.codeplane/config.yaml`

### Global config example

```yaml
tools:
  mcp:
    github:
      command: npx
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    postgres:
      command: uvx
      args: ["mcp-postgres"]
      env:
        DATABASE_URL: "${DATABASE_URL}"
```

### Repo-level example (`.vscode/mcp.json`)

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Disabling servers per-repo

Add a `.codeplane.yml` file to the repository root:

```yaml
tools:
  mcp:
    disabled:
      - postgres
```

This prevents the `postgres` MCP server from starting for jobs in this repo, even if it's defined globally.

## UI Settings

Additional preferences are available in **Settings** (`Ctrl+,`): registered repositories, default agent, model preferences, and push notification settings.

### Push Notifications

Toggle push notifications in **Settings → Notifications**. Notifications are delivered via the Web Push protocol. When enabled for the first time, your browser will ask for permission.

VAPID keys are generated automatically on first startup and stored in `~/.codeplane/vapid.json`. No manual configuration is required.

Notifications fire on three events:

| Event | Notification |
|-------|--------------|
| `approval_requested` | "Approval needed" — a job is waiting for your decision |
| `job_completed` | "Job completed" — the agent finished |
| `job_failed` | "Job failed" — the run encountered an error |

### Job Sharing

Share tokens are generated on demand from the job detail toolbar (**Share** button). Tokens expire after 24 hours and are stored in-memory — a server restart invalidates all tokens.

Shared links bypass CodePlane's password for read-only access to job status and live events. The viewer must still be able to reach the server (e.g. via the same tunnel or LAN). No configuration is required.

### Port Preview Proxy

A reverse proxy at `/api/preview/{port}/` forwards to `127.0.0.1:{port}`. This is useful when combined with `--remote` to access development servers from another device. Only ports 1024–65535 are allowed.
