/**
 * TraceForge SSE ingestion adapter.
 *
 * The backend serializes each `traceforge.SessionEvent` to the SSE wire as-is:
 *   - the SSE `event:` line is the dotted kind (e.g. "job.state_changed",
 *     "tool.call.completed", "permission.requested");
 *   - the SSE `data:` line is the full event envelope
 *     `{ id, kind, session_id, timestamp, payload, metadata }` where `payload`
 *     is the raw control-plane payload in **snake_case**.
 *
 * This module adapts that wire shape into the store's internal camelCase
 * domain model at the ingestion boundary (used by `useSSE`), so the store
 * handlers keep reading the camelCase fields they always have. It:
 *   1. deep-converts payload keys snake_case -> camelCase (`normalizeTFEvent`);
 *   2. injects the envelope-derived fields handlers expect (`jobId` from
 *      `session_id`, `timestamp`, `turnId`/tool enrichment from `metadata`);
 *   3. re-derives the job-state transitions the backend previously emitted as a
 *      secondary `job_state_changed` frame — those are now computed on the FE
 *      from the dotted kind (`deriveJobStateFrame`).
 *
 * There is no reverse (camel -> snake) path and no old-wire vocabulary: the
 * wire speaks TraceForge; this adapter is purely the FE's own domain mapping.
